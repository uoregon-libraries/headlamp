# Archive path format: this should express the path using the keywords
# "project", "date", and "ignore".  There must be exactly one occurrence of
# "project", designating which path element specifies the project name.  There
# must be one "date" as well, which tells us which folder represents the
# archive date (in YYYY-MM-DD format).  There can be any number of "ignore"
# elements in the path, each of which are simply ignored in order to form the
# "public" path.  e.g., "project/ignore/date" would state that the top-level
# folder is the project name and the next two folders are collapsed, while the
# third is stored as the archive date.  "ignore/project/date" might be used for
# "Volume/project/date" style archives.

# Inventory file glob: a pattern to find all the inventory files, such as
# "*/*/INVENTORY/*.csv".  The files should be discoverable by taking the path
# of the inventory file, removing the filename, adding "../" and the filename.
# e.g., project/date/INVENTORY/foo.csv might describe "bar/baz.tiff", which
# could be found at project/date/INVENTORY/../bar/baz.tiff, or
# project/date/bar/baz.tiff.  Note that "manifest.csv" is automatically skipped
# as those files are always our composite inventories.
